[PyEMMA](http://pyemma.org) (EMMA = Emma's Markov Model Algorithms) is an open source Python/C package for analysis of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

### Content

The first [notebook ðŸ““](notebooks/00-pentapeptide-showcase.ipynb) in this tutorial guides through the basic analysis workflow using real MD data of a pentapeptide:

We keep the details minimal throughout the showcase but point to the more specialized notebooks which allow you to go in-depth on selected topics.

In detail, the remaining eight notebooks revisit all aspects shown in the showcase, provide additional details and variants, and contain exercises (and solutions) to self-check your learning progress:

1. Data-I/O and featurization [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/01-data-io-and-featurization.ipynb)
2. Dimension reduction and discretization [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/02-dimension-reduction-and-discretization.ipynb)
3. MSM estimation and validation [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/03-msm-estimation-and-validation.ipynb)
4. MSM analysis [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/04-msm-analysis.ipynb)
5. PCCA and TPT analysis [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/05-pcca-tpt.ipynb)
6. Expectations and observables [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/06-expectations-and-observables.ipynb)
7. Hidden Markov state models (HMMs) [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/07-hidden-markov-state-models.ipynb)
8. Common problems & bad data situations [âžœ ðŸ““](notebooks/08-common-problems.ipynb)

**Please note that this is a work in progress and we value any kind of feedback that helps us improving this tutorial.**

### Installation
We recommended to install the PyEMMA tutorials with conda. The following command will create a new environment that comes with all the dependencies of the tutorial.

If you do not have conda, please follow the instructions here:

https://conda.io/miniconda.html

#### Installing the tutorials as a package

After installing miniconda, you can install the tutorial either via

``` bash
conda create -n pyemma_tutorials -c conda-forge pyemma_tutorials
```

... or you can also install the tutorial in an existing environment by

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyemma_tutorials
```

If you intend to install with pip, for which can not give any support, you feel free to run:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/markovmodel/pyemma_tutorials
```

#### Manual installation

If you wish to install the tutorial manually, you will need the following packages (including all their dependencies):

- `pyemma`
- `mdshare`
- `nglview`
- `nbexamples`
- `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`

This can be done, for example, with conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyemma mdshare nglview nbexamples jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
```

After installing `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`, you need to activate the `toc2` and `exercise2` extensions:

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable exercise2/main
```

Now all remains is to clone the repository to get the tutorial notebooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markovmodel/pyemma_tutorials.git
```

### Usage
Now we have a fresh conda environment containing the notebooks and the software to run them. We can now just activate the environment and run the notebook server by invoking:

``` bash
conda activate pyemma_tutorials  # skip this, if you have installed in your root environment or used pip to install.
pyemma_tutorials
```

The last command will start the notebook server and your browser should pop up pointing to a list of notebooks. You can choose either to preview or to create your own copy of the notebook. The latter will create a copy of the chosen notebook in your home directory, so your changes will not be lost after shutting down the notebook server.

If you have a manual installation, move to the repository's notebook directory...

```bash
cd path_to_pyemma_tutorials/notebooks
```

... and start the notebook server there:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Deinstallation

To uninstall you can remove the whole environment which will also uninstall the contained software again:
``` bash
conda env remove -n pyemma_tutorials
```

or if you have installed the package directly

``` bash
conda remove pyemma_tutorials
```
